        Fried Chicken is a beloved dish known for its crispy, golden-brown exterior and juicy, tender meat. It is typically made by coating chicken pieces in a seasoned flour mixture and then deep-frying them until they reach the perfect level of crunchiness. This dish is often enjoyed with sides like mashed potatoes, coleslaw, or biscuits, making it a comforting and satisfying meal for many.
